Snake Game üêç


A classic Snake Game built in Python using the pygame library! Control the snake to eat food, grow longer, and try to avoid hitting the walls or itself. This project is a fun way to learn about basic game development concepts in Python.

Features

Simple Controls: Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
Score Tracking: See your score increase as the snake eats food.
Game Over Screen: Game ends if the snake hits itself or the wall.
Restart Option: Play again after each game over.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pygame library
Installing pygame


To install pygame, run:

pip install pygame
Running the Game
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-python.git
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd snake-game-python
Run the game:

python snake_game.py
Gameplay Instructions
Control the Snake: Use the arrow keys (‚Üë, ‚Üì, ‚Üê, ‚Üí) to move the snake in different directions.
Objective: Guide the snake to eat the food (small squares) to grow longer and increase your score.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.
Scoring
Each piece of food eaten increases the score by 10 points.

Example Code
Here's a small snippet of the main game loop:

Copy code
while not game_over:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            game_over = True
        # Handle key events to control the snake
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                direction = 'UP'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                direction = 'DOWN'
            # Add other directions
    # Update the snake's position and check for collisions
